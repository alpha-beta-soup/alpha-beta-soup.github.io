Petersen</li>\n<li><em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, J.R.R. Tolkien</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Travelling</h1>\n<p>I recently had a work trip to Québec City for nine days for a workshop. The city is beautiful, particularly the churches in the old city. I went to Mass in French twice at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Roch\">St-Roch</a>; the first time homeless people interrupted the Consecration, but to my joy the parishioners treated them with concern and compassion. Because I was excited to <em>finally</em> use old-style confessionals, I also went to Confession <em>twice</em> (once at St-Roch, and once at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral-Basilica_of_Notre-Dame_de_Qu%C3%A9bec\">Notre-Dame de Québec Basilica-Cathedral</a>). As a Catholic, visiting Québec felt like a pilgrimage of sorts, although that was not at all my travel intention. While I do have a Québecois friend who takes his faith seriously and has been an important influence for me, it’s just the sheer number of churches that strikes you as an inescapable fact when wandering around the city. Now that quite a number of them have been deconsecrated and repurposed, and religosity in general being much lower than in the past, it’s hard to understand why so many were even needed in the first place.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"blog-figure\"><img src=\"images/quebec-1.jpg\" title=\"Notre Dame des Victoires: the oldest church in Quebec City—and the only one I wanted to go inside which I was unable to do so.\" class=\"blog-img\"><figcaption class=\"blog-figcaption\">Notre Dame des Victoires: the oldest church in Quebec City—and the only one I wanted to go inside which I was unable to do so</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h1>Parenting</h1>\n<p>Callum is seven months old tomorrow. He’s sitting, but does not sit up of his own accord. That is, he’ll stay sitting if we start him off that way. We read that spilling should have stopped by about 6 months for the average child, and we suspect that his delay in sitting up is directly linked to his continued spilling. Naturally we’re sick of all the vomit and we really want him to sit more in order to develop his core muscles.</p>\n<p>Callum’s really engaged with his toys. I try to read to him in the afternoon, but he’s of an age where all he does is reach out to grab a book and put it in his mouth. I’m not sure if I should persevere or wait a bit longer.</p>\n<h1>Listening</h1>\n<p>Still lots of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill-out_music#Lo-fi_hip_hop\">chill hop</a>.</p>\n<h1>Working</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Linked Data implementations of the OGC API (i.e. WFS 3).</li>\n<li>Data visualisation of time series soil moisture, à la the Github <a href=\"https://github.com/DKirwan/calendar-heatmap\">“calendar heatmap”</a> as a React single page application.</li>\n<li>Researching the quantification of flood risk with a low data requirement. Currently considering the calculation of “height above nearest drainage” (HAND) normalised DEM. I will probably turn this into a plugin for QGIS 3.</li>\n<li>Still freelancing as well, although not as much as I could or should be.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Cooking</h1>\n<p>Lots of slow cooked meals for winter.</p>\n<h1>Thinking</h1>\n<p>About the moral licitness of IVF.</p>\n<h1>Exercising</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/112328163/palmerston-norths-new-cycle-and-pedestrian-bridge-lights-up\">An enormously expensive new bridge</a> was built over the Manawatū river. The bridge considerably shortened my commute. I cycle over it each day; I’m planning to run more when it’s warmer.</p>\n<h1>Learning</h1>\n<p>The basics of electronics, IoT, and sensors with an Arduino Uno. The local Jaycar electronics store recently ran an Arduino introductory tutorial that demystified a lot of this for me. I bought a book and I’m really excited about the possibilities.
