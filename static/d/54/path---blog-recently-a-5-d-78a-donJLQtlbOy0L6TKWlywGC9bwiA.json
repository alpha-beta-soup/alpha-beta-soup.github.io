Petersen</li>\n<li><em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, J.R.R. Tolkien</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Travelling</h1>\n<p>I recently had a work trip to Québec City for nine days for a workshop. The city is beautiful, particularly the Churches. I went to Mass in French twice at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Roch\">St-Roch</a>; the first time homeless people interrupted the Consecration, but to my joy the parishioners treated them with concern and compassion. Because I was excited to <em>finally</em> use old style confessionals, I also went to Confession <em>twice</em> (once at St-Roch, and once at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral-Basilica_of_Notre-Dame_de_Qu%C3%A9bec\">Notre-Dame de Québec Basilica-Cathedral</a>). As a Catholic, visiting Québec felt like a pilgrimage of sorts, although that was not at all my travel intention. While I do have a Québecois friend who takes his faith seriously and has been an important influence for me, it’s just the sheer number of churches that strikes you as an inescapable fact when wandering around the city. Now that quite a large number of them are deconsecrated and repurposed, it’s hard to understand why so many where even needed in the first place.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"blog-figure\"><img src=\"images/quebec-1\" title=\"The oldest church in Quebec City—and the only one I wanted to go inside which I was unable to do so.\" class=\"blog-img\"><figcaption class=\"blog-figcaption\">The oldest church in Quebec City—and the only one I wanted to go inside which I was unable to do so</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h1>Parenting</h1>\n<p>Callum is seven months old tomorrow. He’s sitting, but does not sit up of his own accord. That is, he’ll stay sitting if we start him off that way. We read that spilling should have stopped by about 6 months for the average child, and we suspect that his delay in sitting up is directly linked to his continued spilling. Naturally we’re over all the vomit and really want him to sit more to develop his core muscles.</p>\n<p>Callum’s really engaged with his toys. I try to read to him in the afternoon, but he’s of an age where all he does is reach out to grab a book and put it in his mouth. I’m not sure if I should persevere or wait a bit longer.</p>\n<h1>Listening</h1>\n<p>Still lots of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chill-out_music#Lo-fi_hip_hop\">chill hop</a>.</p>\n<h1>Working</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Linked Data implementations of the OGC API (i.e. WFS 3).</li>\n<li>Data visualisation of time series soil moisture, à la the Github <a href=\"https://github.com/DKirwan/calendar-heatmap\">“calendar heatmap”</a> as a React single page application.</li>\n<li>Researching the quantification of flood risk with a low data requirement. Currently considering the calculation of “height above nearest drainage” (HAND) normalised DEM. I will probably turn this into a plugin for QGIS 3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Cooking</h1>\n<p>Lots of slow cooked meals for winter.</p>\n<h1>Thinking</h1>\n<p>About the moral licitness of IVF.</p>\n<h1>Exercising</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/112328163/palmerston-norths-new-cycle-and-pedestrian-bridge-lights-up\">An enormously expensive new bridge</a> was built over the Manawatū river. The bridge considerably shortened my commute. I cycle over it each day; I’m planning to run more when it’s warmer.</p>\n<h1>Learning</h1>\n<p>The basics of electronics, IoT, and sensors with an Arduino Uno.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Recently","date":"09:30 PM, Tuesday July 30, 2019","updated":null,"path":null},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/recently/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/recently/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/gis-se-improvement-tip-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GIS StackExchange Improvement Tip #1","updated":null,"date":"2018-12-10T18:04:00.000Z","path":null,"tags":["stackexchange"]}},"next":null}}
