A project I’ve been working on recently at work consists of a WebSocket server (using ws4py) that operates as an aggregator for real-time spatial data from a variety of sources (also implemented as WebSockets). Connecting to it is as simple as <code class=\"language-text\">wss://host:port/api-version/service</code> and then valid GeoJSON gets pushed to the browser. I don’t think I can say much about the project, but I can say it has transformed how I see the delivery of spatial data over the Internet for time-critical applications. I’d love it if the NZTA got around to implementing something like this for its traffic alert APIs.</p>\n<p>I also have the beginnings of a QGIS plugin that connects to a specified WebSocket and will render arriving messages, provided they come as GeoJSON.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Geodata web services","date":"09:04 PM, Saturday January 16, 2016","updated":null,"path":null},"fields":{"slug":"/geodata-web-services/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/geodata-web-services/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/nd-spatial-indexes-postgis/indes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"3D spatial indexes in PostGIS","updated":null,"date":"2015-12-19T14:37:19.000Z","path":null,"tags":["PostGIS"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/traffic-dashboard/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"NZ Traffic Dashboard","updated":null,"date":"2017-12-31T14:25:00.000Z","path":"/blog/nz-traffic-dashboard","tags":["portfolio","development","react","JavaScript","transport","New Zealand","NZTA"]}}}}
