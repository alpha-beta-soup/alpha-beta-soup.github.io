I’m going to move my blog here from my old blog/portfolio website (nearimprov.com). I wanted to try out Gatsby JS, so that I could build some little React components and include them in various places. I’ve used React a lot over the last two years, and since I’ve accepted a new job with a lot less web development, I might have the desire to make some components for fun rather than for profit.</p>\n<h3>Why “Spatial Paralysis”</h3>\n<p>Well, I really just wanted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A domain that is better than “nearimprov.com”. This was easy, since the old domain communicated exactly nothing. I think I picked it with a random generator of word pairs until I arrived at a pair of words that sounded like more than nothing, but less than anything.</li>\n<li>A domain that communicates “spatial”. My Masters degree is in geographic information systems. Although I have general reservations about the field, for better or for worse my hat is in the ring. Spatial systems are my speciality, and—momentarily putting aside all forms of imposter syndrome—I’m an expert in the field.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gatsby Blog","date":"December 08, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/gatsby-blog/","previous":null,"next":null}}
