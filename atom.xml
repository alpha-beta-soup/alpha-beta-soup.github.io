    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently been fortunate enough to gain access to the real-time information (RTI)
for buses and trains in the Wellington region. This is the information that gets displayed in the
box at your bus or train stop giving an estimate of how many minutes until your bus arrives.
This information isn&rsquo;t publicly available as a download or as an API, although
you can try your luck looking at <a href="http://m.metlink.org.nz/stop/5006" title="Change the number at the end of the URL for a different stop">the mobile version of the Metlink website</a>.
Building statistics from that is a different thing entirely. I tried to write a
program to scrape the information, but you have to look at each stop individually
and &lsquo;Due&rsquo;, &lsquo;2 mins&rsquo;, &lsquo;3 mins&rsquo;, etc. isn&rsquo;t actually very useful beyond catching your service.</p>

<p>So. Without further ado, here is something I whipped up today. It demonstrates not
only the travel time variation along a single bus route, but also how the mean travel
time changes according to different conditions. In particular, I added information
to the dates stored with the data to be able to distinguish trips made on &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo;
weekdays where people are going to work and school, school holiday weekdays, and weekends.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://alpha-beta-soup.github.io/images/airport91_ttcomparison.png' width='' height='' title='Travel time data from the Greater Wellington Regional Council. Open in new tab for larger.'><span class='caption-text'>Travel time data from the Greater Wellington Regional Council. Open in new tab for larger.</span></span></p>

<p>This data covers all of April 2014. This year, both primary and secondary school holidays
began on April 17, and lasted until May 5, so the data is split roughly evenly between weekdays
where little Johhny is being ferried to school, and days when he is not. Most of us know from
experience that traffic congestion is worse in the school term than in the school holidays.
But how much? Well, if we take <a href="http://www.metlink.org.nz/timetables/bus/091/inbound" title="Click to see the route">the Airport Flyer bus route</a> as a unit of analysis, school-related
congestion adds about 14 minutes of travel time across the length of the route. This mostly accrues between
Jackson St and Murphy St. For those of you playing at home, that&rsquo;s the longest stretch between stops at
approximately 15 kilometres, and takes in the busiest section of State Highway 2 and the
urban motorway. However, from experience as a rider on this route, a lot of this
additional travel time comes from Petone (Jackson St/Hutt Rd, attempting to get
onto SH2). Also from experience as a resident in Petone, <strong>school congestion is a total
time killer</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What varies?</h2>

<hr />

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s back up a bit, because I can hear a few voices at the back. What can cause
variation in travel time apart from school-related congestion? Here&rsquo;s a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passengers getting on and off</li>
<li>Road maintenance</li>
<li>Bus driver behaviour</li>
<li>Non-school related road congestion</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>Possibly some other things</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, it is possible to separate out these different effects, although I leave that
as an exercise for the reader. I picked only a single month to ensure I&rsquo;d be comparing
apples with apples to the greatest extent possible. Admittedly, April <strong>did</strong> see a bit of roadworks
between Petone and Wellington that would have affected this route. However, this work
was being performed just as intensely during the school term and the weekend as for the
rest of April&mdash;so there is no reason to attribute the difference to that.</p>

<p>School children don&rsquo;t typically board the Airport bus, not only because it goes to the
Airport, but because it carries a surcharge. Some amount of variation is perhaps due to buses
on this route getting stuck behind the buses on other routes which school children are
boarding in the school term, and are not boarding in the holidays.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been noted that New Zealand has seen a significant increase in the proportion
of children and teenagers who are driven (or drive themselves) to school. Often the
impact on obesity is noted, as well as the opportunity cost of missed early morning
exercise which could help boost attention spans.</p>

<p>However, I have not seen it mentioned how this effects our transport system beyond
a general acceptance that congestion is worse. Although
I have only shown you one chart, I have played around with displaying the same information
for a variety of routes. The typical result for buses is that the mean travel time is greater
during the school term than outside of it. In terms of the variation around this mean, every example
I have plotted has shown a much greater standard deviation of travel time.</p>

<p>What does that mean? It means buses are generally getting stuck in school traffic,
causing people to be <strong>later than they otherwise need to be</strong>, or making them leave home earlier than otherwise.
It means <strong>buses are more late more often</strong>; people have <strong>less certainty about their arrival time</strong>, and the <strong>schedule becomes
less and less useful as a tool to reduce the amount of time you spend waiting</strong>.</p>

<p>Notably, the effect is much more limited for rail services, which do not want to put up
with any of that school-gate SUV madness.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting historical map that turned up on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/27yfn0/isochronic_passage_chart_for_travelers_global_map/" title="Link to Reddit thread">/r/MapPorn</a> today. Made by
Francis Galton for the Proceedings of the Royal Geographic Society in 1881, I find
it particularly interesting because it represents the state of international travel
only a decade or so after my Scottish and Irish ancestors travelled to New Zealand
(via way of Cape Town, where one of my great-great aunts was born <em>en route</em>).</p>

It is supposed that local preparations have been made and that other circumstances are favourable.</span></span></p>

<p>The work of cartographers past is often so impressive on their own merits (although
I suspect the chaff has been cut with time) yet when you also consider the technology
that they <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> have to make their maps&hellip; the mind boggles and you realise that all of use
currently practising the skill have it so easy. Really, if work of this calibre could be made then,
there are no excuses for bad maps now.</p>

<p>One particular technique I&rsquo;d like to draw attention to is the shape of the coastlines.
They&rsquo;re <em>really wobbly</em>. I suspect this is probably because nice little shapefiles didn&rsquo;t
exist for downloading&mdash;-but the effect that this has is to express that coastlines are
complex features even if that complexity isn&rsquo;t well known. Rather than generalise
coastlines to rather round shapes (which would be fine at this scale, really), they
have been deliberately given additional complexity: it&rsquo;s anti-generalisation.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware, this would be quite hard to achieve with modern software. You would have
to first add vertices to existing shapes at not-quite-regular intervals, and then shift
the vertices about to get that head-beach in-out effect.</p>

<p>I also really think the colour distinction between land and water with the same
category value is really nifty, and of course is crucial when the main form of
intercontinental travel is by sea (steam ship). It wouldn&rsquo;t really make sense for
travel <em>par avion</em>, or any other mode.</p>

<p>Finally:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is supposed that local preparations have been made and that other circumstances are favourable.</p></blockquote>

<p>I love this. These kind of assumptions have been made for over a hundred years in
transportation analysis and cartography. I wonder if it will ever be possible to completely
overcome them.</p>

    <link href="http://alpha-beta-soup.github.io/blog/2014/06/12/montreal-transit/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-12T17:58:10+12:00</updated>
    <id>http://alpha-beta-soup.github.io/blog/2014/06/12/montreal-transit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This video of Montréal&rsquo;s transit system fell across my path today, made by Colin
Stewart and Ahmed El-Geneidy at McGill University&rsquo;s School of Urban Planning. I&rsquo;ve
been reading a bit of professor El-Geneidy&rsquo;s work recently for my own research, and
I&rsquo;ve recently been entertaining the idea of visiting Montréal for an extended period
of time once I print a thesis onto a reconstituted tree. Providence?</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1ztMm5xmk3M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<p>The video shows 24 hours of transit, from 4:30 in the morning for the Société de
transport de Montréal (STM), drilling down to individual scheduled trips. It distinguishes
between the green, orange, yellow and blue metro lines as well as buses operating every ten minutes
(the purple points) and &ldquo;regular&rdquo; buses (white).</p>

<p>It is presented on quite a high-resolution basemap, with plenty of attendant information.</p>

<p>While it is an interesting look at the network operation, there are a handful of
problems I have with this video that anyone reading may like to think about if
they are to make their own animation.</p>

<p>Note: if you&rsquo;re content with just looking at the cool flashing lights (and it is cool!)
don&rsquo;t bother reading on. I&rsquo;m going to focus on the negatives and leave the positives
as self-evident. Oh, I&rsquo;m such an optimistic young fellow.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Critique</h2>

<hr />

<p>Firstly, the information given in the video margins is a little overbearing, and
isn&rsquo;t even what I would consider to be the most important information. We are not
told what day of the week is represented (weekday schedules are typically different
from Saturday and Sunday schedules), or where the data is from. Even in the video
description, we have no link to further information. It almost seems as though
it is a recruitment device for transit buffs to hit McGill&rsquo;s website. Which worked
for me, let it be known, but I&rsquo;d still like some more information on how this was
constructed&mdash;especially if it is made with open data.</p>

<p>The margin of the video could be improved if the unnecessary information was removed
entirely (and left to text descriptions or the embedding web page) or allowed to fade
out after the first 20 or so seconds. Ideally, only time would remain after this
introductory period.</p>

<p>The base map, although nice in isolation, is too distracting. The blue
&lsquo;pops&rsquo; when it is the least important piece of information on the map. The St. Lawrence
River can be used here to give context to the map, but even in this capacity the basemap
works against intuition by orienting the map away from north. As a foreigner, I am
only vaguely aware of the shape of Montréal, but I still would have recognised it
immediately if north was up as per convention. In short, the colours and orientation
of the basemap ensure the basemap fails at its primary goal of providing immediate
contextual recognition.</p>

<p>Both colour and size are used to distinguish the types of modes represented, which
is appropriate. For the metro lines, the yellow and orange are hard to distinguish
on moving objects that (seem?) to share a line, although the use of a track is good.
I don&rsquo;t know if the capacity of a vehicle on the metro is several orders of magnitude
greater than a bus, but it probably is, and the relative size of the metro to the buses
is appropriate. However I think the metro points are probably a little too big, as they
bleed into each other and obscure the bus routes.</p>

<p>I think the two types of bus should have points of the same size (unless one has
a greater per-vehicle capacity), and allow small traces for the vehicles to distinguish
the higher frequency in one, which should emerge naturally if they are indeed high-frequency.</p>

<p>It is also worth asking whether the format is appropriate. Is a video a useful format
for presenting this information? The people in the comments seem happy enough, with
only one or two pointing out that this shows an idealised system where nothing comes
early or late&hellip; or arrives with no seats left. Could an interactive data visualisation
show the same information with additional value? I think so; particularly in that
I&rsquo;d like to zoom into particular neighbourhoods. I do appreciate, however, that
the authors of the video probably did this in their free time, and a video has higher
bang for your buck.</p>

<p>The other in-your-face issue with video as a format is that you&rsquo;re stuck with the
frame rate the authors found most interesting&hellip; or bearable given the number of times
they must have seen this in preparing it. I&rsquo;d love to slow it down during the busiest
moments, but alas.</p>

<p>The music. No comment. Mute it. Yuck.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<hr />

<p>Overall, this is an effective and interesting visualisation, but one that needs
a tidy-up around the edges&mdash;literally and figuratively.</p>
