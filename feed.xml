        <title>Crash Analysis System: The Narrative Arc</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For several years, up until at least June 2015, the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) published the data underlying their Crash Analysis System (CAS). This included information on every Police-attended road crash or accident in New Zealand, with attendant information on the environment it occurred in, and what was deemed to have contributed to the accident. While the method of publishing this data was primitive,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-id-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-id-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;It consisted of one CSV file for each calendar year, with each record in the file heavily encoded. Decoding required automation and a lot of sifting through several PDFs, and a tool to get machine-readable tables from them. An example record is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&#39;Ashburton District&#39;,&#39;MOORE ST&#39;,&#39;100&#39;,&#39;N&#39;,&#39; &#39;,&#39;WILLIAM ST&#39;,&#39;201531749&#39;,&#39;07/02/2015&#39;,&#39;Sat&#39;,&#39;2335&#39;,&#39;EA&#39;,&#39;CN1V&#39;,&#39;103A 129A &#39;,&#39;M&#39;,&#39;R&#39;,&#39;D&#39;,&#39;DO&#39;,&#39;F &#39;,&#39; &#39;,&#39; &#39;,&#39;C&#39;,&#39;050&#39;,&#39;0&#39;,&#39;0&#39;,&#39;0&#39;,&#39;&#39;,&#39;&#39;,&#39;1499510&#39;,&#39;5137544&#39;,&lt;/code&gt; and yes that whitespace in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&#39;F &#39;&lt;/code&gt; is actually meaningful. &lt;/span&gt; it was sufficient for people with a little bit of time to spare (me) and an unhealthy obsession with transportation issues (me) to make use of it. While in many ways it was a good example of how not to do open data, at the very least it existed, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statschat.org.nz/?s=foreign+drivers&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mixnmashentry.blogspot.co.nz/&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; could take it and run with it. All the NZTA had to do was sit back and watch, massage new data, and upload a new file every three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rising-action&quot;&gt;Rising Action&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I found this dataset one afternoon in 2014, I set to work making a prototype &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nearimprov.com/national-crash-statistics/&quot;&gt;map visualisation&lt;/a&gt;. My initial concern at the time was just trying to see the frequency of different type of accidents involving cyclists along my commute home between Wellington and Petone. I wanted to know this for my own curiousity and safety, but I also wanted to share it with members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/166036183455868/&quot;&gt;Cycle Aware Wellington Facebook group&lt;/a&gt;, because I thought it would be useful to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raw CAS data is useless by itself, so interested people in this group would not be able to use it. If I had to write some code to decode a portion of the CAS data for consumption by people, then I would have to be able to do it for every accident in the system. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alpha-beta-soup/national-crash-statistics&quot;&gt;So that’s what I did&lt;/a&gt;, very slowly, iteratively, while procrastinating from my university work, with the help of a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the first time I sent people to it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/cas-saga/nzcm-v0-fb.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was buggy as Hell but seemed well-received, and I was inspired to keep working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/cas-saga/nzcm-v0-db-comments.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I first decoded the CAS records:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/cas-saga/nzcm-v0.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it’s done &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nearimprov.com/national-crash-statistics/&quot;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Astute readers will notice that this is the decoded visual summary of the raw data pasted in the margin further up the page. Would you ever have worked that out?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/cas-saga/asburton-example.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of the utility of this kind of visualisation, note that the only other way to see this data decoded is to sign up for what I call the “NZTA Experience”. Apparently the NZTA has heard of the Internet, but they make you download an additional program in order to use it… and ask that you please forward all queries to your hand-dandy in-house IT team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/cas-saga/actual-cas-wtf.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;./assets/cas-saga/cas9-video.wmv&quot;&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;./assets/cas-saga/cas12-video.wmv&quot;&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; are a little bit sad/funny. They give an insight into the &lt;em&gt;awesome UI&lt;/em&gt; I was missing out on by not signing a license agreement and using their system to view a text file.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-id-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-id-2&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Credit where it’s due: there’s a lot in that bloated interface that I wouldn’t even attempt to implement. I’m sure it’s useful for a number of use cases. It just would be great if it was possible to use it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took one look at this option before deciding it wasn’t for me. I don’t even know what a “Citrix Receiver 3.1” is, but apparently it’s a Windows thing… NZTA, if you require people to have licenses for proprietary software to access open data, the data is not open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the liberty of downloading the linked documents, for posterity. Here are links to them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cas-privacy-agreement-v1docxassetscas-sagacas-privacy-agreement-v1docx&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;./assets/cas-saga/CAS-Privacy-Agreement-v1.docx&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CAS-Privacy-Agreement-v1.docx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An MS Word privacy agreement that must be signed to use the NZTA’s CAS viewer. (&lt;a href=&quot;./assets/cas-saga/CAS-Privacy-Agreement-v1.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;.) In particular, it stipulates that no-one can access or use CAS data unless they have been entitled to do so by the NZTA in writing. I figured that providing the data for download absolved me from this, and these statements were only to be found in relation to accessing the Citrix system. I was never told otherwise. There was no fee associated with using CAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This agreement includes this following &lt;em&gt;Purpose of collection of infomation&lt;/em&gt; (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All information collected for use in CAS is collected in order to obtain and analyse accurate data in respect of traffic crashes in New Zealand.  Analysis of the information allows &lt;strong&gt;the NZTA&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;other government agencies&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;agencies engaged in activities that contribute to the furtherance of road safety in New Zealand&lt;/strong&gt; to make significant contributions to crash prevention and wider road safety in New Zealand.  This includes contributing to the achievement of the Government policy objectives recorded in New Zealand’s Road Safety Strategy 2010-2020, Safer Journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems pretty clear that the CAS data is designed from the outset to exclude the wider public from being able to interpret the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also abundantly clear that the NZTA is preoccupied with the privacy risks associated with this data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14.3&lt;/strong&gt;	In particular the customer must do everything reasonably within its power to prevent any access, use or disclosure of the information other than that which is expressly provided for in this agreement, and will not, or allow a user to, further disclose any information unless the information is in a form in which individuals cannot be identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see why my map may have ruffled some feathers. I just hope they can see how unreasonable their access to CAS-the-system is, given how useful and important CAS-the-data is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my informal and naïve tastes, there’s a considerable amount of legalse in this document, so I’d really appreciate any interpretations of it (leave a comment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, here’s a gem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13.1&lt;/strong&gt;	The NZTA will make all reasonable endeavours to provide a secure and reliable system allowing the customer and user to use CAS at all times other than between 5pm and midnight each Saturday, such time being set aside for CAS maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;guide-to-coded-crash-reportspdfassetscas-sagaguide-to-coded-crash-reportspdf&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;./assets/cas-saga/guide-to-coded-crash-reports.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;guide-to-coded-crash-reports.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My program uses the information in this PDF to decode the raw CSV data to a more meaningful GeoJSON structure, which then gets rendered in your browser. Go to page 15 to see the breakdown of the several hundred possible contributions to a crash. One crash can have as many of these explanations as needed; most explanations are additionally assigned to one of the parties to the crash, keyed by the type of vehicle, even working around the case where there are multiple vehicles of the same type in a crash. That’s a pretty complex structure, and &lt;em&gt;kudos&lt;/em&gt; for the NZTA for managing to cram that into a CSV!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;casp24pdfassetscas-sagacasp24pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;./assets/cas-saga/CASp24.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CASp24.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report prepared by Beca on some cycling project that includes images showing the NZTA’s CAS interface as it stood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;casp27pdfassetscas-sagacasp27pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;./assets/cas-saga/CASp27.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CASp27.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report prepared by OPUS on a cycling project in Wellington that includes an Appendix showing the use of CAS data, including an almost hieroglyphic map of the movements of parties involved in accidents in their case study area.&lt;label for=&quot;mf-id-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot;&gt;⊕&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;mf-id-1&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;fullwidth&quot; src=&quot;/./assets/cas-saga/heiroglyphics.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;confrontation&quot;&gt;Confrontation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2015, the data stopped being updated. The last update was for the first three months of 2015, which was published in June that year. The next three months’ of data was due in September, but never came. Then, the links to the old data—all 15.25 years of it—disappeared from the NZTA website in silence. Now, if you wanted to see the CAS data, you had no choice but to sign up for the NZTA Experience. Once there, you would not be able to tell people about any of the disaggregate information you have access to, per the terms of the agreement you have to sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that make sense to anyone? Let’s run through what I make of the NZTA’s thought process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are worried about the privacy implications of people looking at details of individual crashes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To protect privacy while balancing the need for organisations to actually use this information, the NZTA Experience (&lt;em&gt;SecureCAS&lt;/em&gt;) exists to allow people access to CAS only after signing an agreement that stipulates that you can’t show other people disaggregate information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third party applications using the raw data that are not subject to the license agreement should be discouraged through the non-publication of the raw data, in order to protect privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The data is still open; anyone can access the raw data, it just has to be through the NZTA Experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right. So I (as a third-party developer) can’t make a web application that displays the details of individual accidents to the public, but any individual member of the public can sign up for &lt;em&gt;SecureCAS&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;If privacy is the motivating force for the decision to not publish the raw data, what difference does it make if the public uses my application, or SecureCAS?&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimately, if someone wants disaggregate information, they can get it. I just made it easier. I made it so people attending a meeting of the Hutt Cycle Network can pull out a laptop and zoom to an area being discussed, and start using facts instead of perception.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-id-3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-id-3&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;When I was a member of this group, I was really happy to see people using it, and finding it easy to access information they didn’t even know existed. I see the publication of the raw data as potentially addressing a power imbalance between the road controlling authorities, who have had knowledge of and access to SecureCAS for years, and Joe Public, who didn’t even know this data was collected. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I noticed that the data had not been updated, I sent the following email to the Statistical Analysis team at the NZTA asking for an explanation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard&lt;/strong&gt;: I was looking to update my record of the CAS data, but the page I have used in the past no longer exists: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/crash-analysis-system-data/&quot;&gt;https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/crash-analysis-system-data/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I noticed a few weeks ago that although it was up, the available data only went as far as March this year. Is this data still available for download?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NZTA&lt;/strong&gt;: Apologies for the delay in replying to your email. We are currently reviewing the CAS information we have available on our website to make sure it meets our privacy and security standards. As &lt;strong&gt;the new on line data will be summarised information&lt;/strong&gt; and I understand you work with geospatial co-ordinates, would you like to apply for CAS access? This will give you access to the same level of information as was previously on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes I suppose I would like to apply for access, provided that the access will not cost me as I’m only using it as a hobbyist.&lt;br /&gt;
However I’m using the CAS data to make a public web map (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nearimprov.com/national-crash-statistics/&quot;&gt;http://www.nearimprov.com/national-crash-statistics/&lt;/a&gt;) in collaboration with some others. &lt;strong&gt;Will this review mean that my application will not be able to present the disaggregate information to the public?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard&lt;/strong&gt; (after a week without a response): Is there any information on this review available? I have some free time available over this summer I am planning to spend developing my mapping application, but I first need to know if the data will still be able to be made public via my application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NZTA&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks for your email. There is no cost associated with access to CAS, but you will be required to sign a data agreement. &lt;strong&gt;Under this agreement you will only be able to make aggregated information (totals of 4 or more) available through your app. Would you like to proceed with getting CAS access?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got very confused at this point, by the definition of “access to CAS”. I didn’t want to touch &lt;em&gt;SecureCAS&lt;/em&gt; with a ten-foot barge pole. I just wanted the raw data to work with on my own. There was still no explanation as to why it had been removed. To date, there appears to be no information on the NZTA website about any review into CAS, including whether any users of CAS data were consulted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no plans to sign up to a restrictive license that would make my crash map next to useless for the applications I originally intended it for. &lt;strong&gt;If I have to aggregate accidents to a minimum of four… I… how do you even do that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, seriously&lt;/em&gt;. Take four accidents at random. One caused by a drunk driver at one in the morning, who hit a pole and was injured severely. One a year earlier at a nearby pedestrian crossing where a driver failed to yield and injured a pedestrian. Another involving a driver reversing from their driveway and hitting a child riding their bike, who later died from their injuries. Another a nose-to-tail caused by a driver actually stopping at a stop sign when the following driver expected them to treat it like a give way sign, but with no one injured. &lt;strong&gt;How do you aggregate these?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could perhaps say how many accidents there were, and how many people were injured or killed in this area. But you can’t even say which type of accident is most prevalent, because they’re all different and you’re not allowed to discuss them in isolation. What if the council is proposing to remove the pedestrian crossing because (they argue) it is dangerous? What use is the aggregate data now? If only you could drill down into the raw data and extract that one accident that occurred on a pedestrian crossing and see why it happened!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if fewer than four accidents even occurred in your suburb or town? Is it even possible to draw this on a map? Can the NZTA actually provide a concrete précis of what this aggregation is supposed to look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The requirement for aggregation of CAS data in third-party applications completely shuts down the utility of the CAS data, and is extremely difficult to comply with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing the email chain, after I essentially told them the above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NZTA&lt;/strong&gt;:  Thanks for your interest in safety data. We are in the process of making a new aggregated CAS data set freely available using the Government’s Open Data initiative. This is the data set that will be publically available from now on without the signing of an agreement. This is the data set you could use for your personal mapping tool.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If someone wishes to obtain data in addition to that made available to the general public via the open data initiative, they will be required to sign a data agreement to place some conditions on how the data may be used, in order to ensure data is kept appropriately secure and to protect the privacy of those individuals represented in the data set. For example, you would be able to use the data for research purposes and publish the results in an aggregated form.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I understand, however, that you would like data variables over and above the data that we will be making available via the government open data initiative or that has been published in the past. The way in which we can make certain additional variables available to you is by providing you with CAS access so that you can extract the additional data yourself, however, you will be required to sign a data agreement which places certain conditions on how you may use the data.
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no cost associated with access to the CAS data base.
&lt;br /&gt;
Please let me know if you wish to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my take on the embigged section of that quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third party applications cannot show disaggregate information because privacy. If someone wants to see the apparently private information, they sure can, they just have to use SecureCAS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, this makes no sense whatsoever. All it achieves is putting up a barrier to people making use of the data. I replied to the email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you so much for the clarification about accessing the CAS data.
&lt;br /&gt;
Is there any documentation about the review into CAS that I may read? My application is predicated on disaggregated data. I’d like to contest that there are valid privacy concerns with the use of the data as it currently stands, and also note that if aggregated, the data is not going to be useful for most of the applications I see for it.
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if required to aggregate to at least four accidents (as previously stated), after I apply multiple filters (e.g. accidents involving pedestrians at a particular pedestrian crossing in Petone 2000-2015 — as I did recently for the Hutt Cycle Network), the number of relevant accidents falls below this number and my map is then no longer useful as an advocacy tool for commenting on highly-local road network changes (a proposed change to the location of the crossing). I can imagine hundreds of possible permutations of the data just like this. If I am only able to show aggregate information, the function of the map will be restricted to commenting on general trends only (e.g. there were x accidents on pedestrian crossings across all of Lower Hutt… but I can’t say where or why exactly). I believe this to be a considerable regression in the utility of the data.
&lt;br /&gt;
I disagree that there are major privacy concerns that justify changing the service in this way. To the extent that I may be wrong or overruled, I propose that there are better ways of addressing these concerns than requiring aggregation (for example, only specifying an approximate date, or randomising the location slightly, or suppressing the reporting of specific accident codes).
&lt;br /&gt;
Has there been consultation with the users of the data before these changes were proposed? Myself and others have put considerable volunteer time into my application and I would have made my comments earlier had I known there were going to be changes.
&lt;br /&gt;
I’m happy to discuss this issue further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point the manager of the Statistical Information team contacted me to arrange a time to discuss in person the issues I was raising. Ultimately this had to be a phone conference between the manager, myself, and James Burgess (Chair, Cycle Aware Wellington).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the call from the rooftop carpark of JB Hi-Fi in central Hamilton, amidst construction noise. During the hour-long phone call James and I felt we were given a fair hearing of our concerns. In particular, we stressed that the requirement to aggregate information is difficult to comply with, and severely diminishes the utility of the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I argued that the privacy concerns are unfounded, because the only way the CAS data is personally identifying is if you already hold additional information about an accident. I also pointed out that news articles already reveal more information than CAS does about serious accidents, but we assured them that my application would never try and link CAS data to any form of media. I conceded that the CAS data did not need to reveal the age of the youngest child involved in an accident,&lt;label for=&quot;sn-id-4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-id-4&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;If a child or children are involved in an accident, the age of the youngest child is reported in the raw CAS data. Age is not reported otherwise. Gender is never given. &lt;/span&gt; but otherwise CAS data should not be changed at all. We provided concrete use cases for disaggregate data in an easy-to-consume web map format, from the perspective of cycling advocacy. We were assured that our concerns would be taken on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of aggregation they were considering was regional, which was worse than I had imagined. The proposed confidentiality agreement would mean only this same level of aggregation would be possible for dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be a follow-up call in two weeks. It felt good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;falling-action&quot;&gt;Falling Action&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;!-- Lack of information about the decision; unsure how to progress and get decision reviewed --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no follow-up call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IBCycleWay&quot;&gt;@IBCycleWay&lt;/a&gt; Twitter handle asked for access to disaggregate CAS data and recieved this response (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NZTA&lt;/strong&gt;: Information from our Crash Analysis System (CAS) is no longer available for download directly from this website. We have recently revised our privacy and confidentiality standards, and the crash information did not meet those new standards. &lt;strong&gt;In some cases, the data included information that, by deduction, meant the person involved could be identified&lt;/strong&gt;. The Privacy Act 1993 is about protecting personal information and it is our duty as an Agency to ensure that personal information is protected and confidentiality of output is maintained. That is why we are now required to aggregate or &lt;strong&gt;suppress values under four.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over the coming weeks, we are working to make aggregated information available for download from this website. Would you like us to email you when this becomes available?
&lt;br /&gt;
You are also able to apply for free access to the data via CAS. Please contact &lt;a href=&quot;cas.administrator@nzta.govt.nz&quot;&gt;cas.administrator@nzta.govt.nz&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to apply for access to CAS.
&lt;br /&gt;
I hope this is of assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what “suppress values under four” means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realising that they were not going to seriously consider my perspective despite all the pestering I’d already put in, I tried another email salvo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard&lt;/strong&gt;: Is there any word on the CAS data review? It has now been over a year since disaggregate data on road crashes and accidents has been been made available to the public, which is affecting the ability of safety advocates to comment on road network changes from the local to the national scale. I have heard through Twitter that a decision has been made with respect to this data, but I have not heard anything official and I still cannot find any information on the NZTA website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m pissing them off now, because the response didn’t even attempt to address me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thanks for your email.
&lt;br /&gt;
As previously discussed, people can apply for free access to CAS for the following purposes:
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Informing transport policy and regulations
&lt;br /&gt;
2. Designing and prioritising a range of network user behaviour and road safety initiatives
&lt;br /&gt;
3. Supporting funding applications for network and road safety improvements
&lt;br /&gt;
4. Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of road safety initiatives
&lt;br /&gt;
5. Providing information for research purposes connected with road network user behaviour, road safety and transport policy.
&lt;br /&gt;
Please do let us know if you would like to apply for access.
&lt;br /&gt;
We are currently working to provide as much aggregated data as possible on our website while maintaining our obligations under the Privacy Act. We will be making this information available over the coming weeks, and will also be providing information as to why the csv files are no longer available. Would you like me to send you a link to the aggregated information when it becomes available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last bit of communication is now two weeks’ old. I thank all those who have reached out to me via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alphabeta_soup&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, email and other channels to offer advice and information about this situation; it has all been taken on board. I’m trying to use this blog post to get all the information and my thoughts into one place, before taking the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;character-growth-and-resolution&quot;&gt;Character Growth and Resolution&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is yet to be a satisfactory resolution for this narrative arc. The aggregate data for download still isn’t ready so I can’t comment on it, and my hand still isn’t ready to agree to the terms of their license agreement. My Linux OS can’t even use Citrix. I think. I still don’t know what Citrix is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have some questions for the NZTA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many privacy issues have actually been encountered to justify this change to operational data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there no available information about this review?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you provide a concrete demonstration of how your proposed aggregation of no fewer than four accidents is supposed to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you open to alternative suggestions about how to protect the privacy of people who have had the misfortune to be involved in an accident, that do not involve aggregation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have some plans my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nearimprov.com/national-crash-statistics/&quot;&gt;crash map&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re mostly shelved until I know that the raw CAS data will be available again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make and expose a public RESTful API to the decoded CAS data, so it’s super easy for even more client applications to proliferate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve my web map interface, including the ability to search crash causes and filter on those, instead of being limited to the filters that I have baked in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve my web map with some server-side code, probably the same API I’m willing to write, so that it can display more than 3 months of data without destroying your browser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add some cool smarts to the web map: e.g. draw an irregular shape on the map and get some summary charts reflecting the crashes inside the shape that meet your non-spatial criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have one question for you, the reader. &lt;strong&gt;What can be done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;supplementary-links&quot;&gt;Supplementary links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.open.org.nz/groups/ninja-talk/messages/topic/4s6b4LltkXJeQaGEmg4fMi#post-4s6b4LltkXJeQaGEmg4fMi&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on the Open Data Ninjas about the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alpha-beta-soup/national-crash-statistics/issues/53&quot;&gt;Github issue&lt;/a&gt; about signing the data agreement, which I do not want to do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The NZTA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/crash-analysis-system/cas.html&quot;&gt;CAS FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, which as of writing seems unchanged, with the exception that the raw data download is missing. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/crash-analysis-system/&quot;&gt;another, similar link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The NZTA’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/crash-analysis-reports/index.html&quot;&gt;pre-aggregated &lt;em&gt;crash analysis reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which summarise CAS data on a regional basis. They’re neat, but personally I want to know about very particular circumstances: I don’t want a summary report, I want data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-note-on-the-snark&quot;&gt;A note on the snark&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do apologise for the level of snark you have just endured. I truly appreciate all the hard work that has gone in to CAS and will continue to go into it. In turn, I hope that those at the NZTA appreciate the frustration that I’ve felt after putting in effort into this application, only for the rug to have been pulled out from underneath it without much explanation. Ultimately we both have similar goals: public safety, and factual information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Geodata web services</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Bill Dollins has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/12/11/building-a-simple-geodata-service-with-node-and-amazon-rds/&quot;&gt;downright useful tutorial&lt;/a&gt; over on his blog for building a straightforward geodata service with Node, Express, PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m actually surprised at how few of these sorts of server applications actually exist, given that they’re reasonably straightforward to set up, and marvelous to use. A project I’ve been working on recently at work consists of a WebSocket server (using ws4py) that operates as an aggregator for real-time spatial data from a variety of sources (also implemented as WebSockets). Connecting to it is as simple as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wss://host:port/api-version/service&lt;/code&gt; and then valid GeoJSON gets pushed to the browser. I don’t think I can say much about the project, but I can say it has transformed how I see the delivery of spatial data over the Internet for time-critical applications. I’d love it if the NZTA got around to implementing something like this for its traffic alert APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have the beginnings of a QGIS plugin that connects to a specified WebSocket and will render arriving messages, provided they come as GeoJSON.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3D spatial indexes in PostGIS&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;And even 4D spatio-teporal indexes!&lt;/small&gt;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just watched Paul Ramsay’s (CartoDB) breakout presentation from &lt;em&gt;PGConf Silicon Valley 2015&lt;/em&gt;. I love watching these kinds of videos. They’re reasonably short (~40 minutes) so are good while you’re eating lunch or killing time. They also tend to have little nuggets of wisdom to solve “gotchas” that for some reason no one has ever told you about. This presentation in particular has lots of these for using PostGIS. One I did not know about was the ability to specify an n-dimensional index in PostGIS. The typical way to construct a two-dimensional GIST index in PostGIS is to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;INDEX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;USING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if you have XYZ or XYZT data and you want to issue queries that take advantage of these additional dimensions with a multidimensional index, you will need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;INDEX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;idx&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;USING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gist_geometry_ops_nd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different operator, internally, means that the spatial functions use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator, rather than the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking recently about trying to get my hands on some LiDAR data. Acquiring this data is apparently very difficult at the moment. But if you use PostGIS, you’re now well-equipped to deal with it… if you can get your hands on it :information_desk_person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, PostGIS allows you to switch out the geometry library from the Geometry Engine Open Source (GEOS) to the SFCGAL (SF (?) Computational Geometry Algorithms Library). SFCGAL is not as broad as GEOS, so if you do make the switch, internally a lot of your functions will still use GEOS. However, as Paul Ramsay notes, SFCGAL has a bunch of additional functions that GEOS does not. These include some interesting 3D functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ST_3DIntersection&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ST_Tesselate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ST_3DArea&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ST_Extrude&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ST_ForceLHR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ST_Orientation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ST_Minkowski&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ST_StraightSkeleton&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ST_ApproximateMedialAxis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SFCGAL will need to be compiled, and then activated within PostgreSQL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;CREATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;EXTENSION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;postgis_sfcgal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;postgis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;backend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;sfcgal&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a dedicated PostgreSQL extension for storing point cloud data: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pgpointcloud/pointcloud&quot;&gt;https://github.com/pgpointcloud/pointcloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in the video, there is a tricky philosophical question, with important geometric implications (never thought I’d say that): &lt;em&gt;What is the intersection of two disjoint polygons?&lt;/em&gt; The sound of a tree falling in the woods? The sound of one hand clapping? Close. It’s a polygon representing the presence of nothing: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;POLYGON EMPTY&lt;/code&gt;. And empty geometry is not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. It’s actually more like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (something with no magnitude, but not exactly nothing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to get &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GEOMETRY EMPTY&lt;/code&gt; is to use a negative buffer value that is larger than the geometry that is being buffered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;65%&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/GSuZP89UdGs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you find useful from this presentation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, if someone can tell me what the “SF” in SFCGAL stands for, I’d really appreciate it. It’s driving me nuts. (Spatial Functions?)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vector fields of population travel demand</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading an interesting paper by Xintao Liu and colleauges entitled &lt;em&gt;Time-geographic relationships between vector fields of activity patterns and transport systems&lt;/em&gt;, in the Journal of Transport Geography.&lt;label for=&quot;sn-id-ref&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-id-ref&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Liu, Xintao, Wai Yeung Yan, and Joseph Y.J. Chow. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692314002191&quot;&gt;‘Time-geographic relationships between vector fields of activity patterns and transport systems.’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Journal of Transport Geography&lt;/em&gt; 42 (2015): 22-33. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/liu.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really have much to say about it, but I’ll post a link to it anyway so I don’t forget about it: I’ve briefly explored this technique in the past, and hope to revisit it in the future. It’s pretty damn hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/commutecontours.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know of any similar examples?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Algorithms Group at Eindhoven University of Technology</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.win.tue.nl/algo/&quot;&gt;the webpage&lt;/a&gt; for the (spatial/geometric/cartograhic) Algorithms Group at &lt;em&gt;Technische Universiteit Eindhoven&lt;/em&gt; (Eindhoven University of Technology). I highly recommend browsing through some of the manuscripts included on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.win.tue.nl/~hermanh//doku.php?id=graduation_projects&quot;&gt;Herman Haverkort’s (and students’) projects page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I found one entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.win.tue.nl/~hermanh//stack/Haverkort-cues-about-travel-time.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Embedding cues about travel time in schematic maps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is an interesting paper on schematic public transport maps, where it is first established that although excellent at allowing users to avoid unnecessary transfers, schematic maps of public transport pay the price of preventing people from determining how long a particular trips are, in both absolute and relative terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/Haverkort1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/Haverkort2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/Haverkort3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haverkort presents a range of ideas for getting the best of both worlds, leading to a portfolio of intriguing ideas about hybridised schematic maps with travel time. I’ve included three of them here, and really encourage you to read the full paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/Haverkort4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/Haverkort5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/Haverkort6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’d be a brilliant challenge to employ some of these ideas for a local network. There are also some interesting papers on automated graph drawing on the TUE webpage; if you’re anything like me, while you can appreciate the necessity and beauty of a one-off piece of cartography, the true Holy Grail is in abstracting and automating the procedure, giving space for updating source information or changing the extent of your geographic focus with minimal to no additional work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.win.tue.nl/algo/graduated-phd-students.php&quot;&gt;PhD theses&lt;/a&gt; that might make some good holiday reading… for uh, weird people like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any other interesting theses or manuscripts to read over the summer? Having completed mine in March this year, I feel I’m in a good space to really appreciate the hard work of others in producing one, so I’m looking to read a few.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Zealand Spatial Excellence Awards&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Reflections following a PostGIS presentation&lt;/small&gt;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just returned from the New Zealand Spatial Excellence Awards for 2015. I was awarded the Postgraduate Student of the Year Award. I’m very slightly tipsy. I also had a very interesting contrasting experience that I think people in the “spatial industry” in New Zealand might be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had quite a tight schedule today, waking up in Raglan, popping into work in the morning, getting to the National Library in Wellington by early afternoon, meeting friends afterwards, attending a PostgreSQL/PostGIS user group meeting at 6, and then skipping out to go to the final NZSEA awards and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PostgreSQL/PostGIS user meeting was great. I had no idea what to expect. Two geo-friends (they’re real friends, we just bond over maps, so therefore they need the geo- preffix, © ESRI) came with me to Catalyst IT on Willis St, Wellington. Inside there were a few couches, and Brent Wood hanging out in shorts and a t-shirt. Dressed up in dress shoes and a shirt (but no jacket and tie), I felt very over-dressed. Brent discussed PostgreSQL/PostGIS, the treatment of geometry primitives in databases, spatial indexes and limitations thereof, MapServer, WMS in QGIS, GEOS, Proj.4, GDAL, and the antimeridian and how PostGIS’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;geography&lt;/code&gt; type gets over many of the attendant problems of that irritating fecking line. Then, we had pizza and I had to skip off without much of a chance to talk to Brent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally ran off to Te Papa, where a nibbles and networking event was going down. People were wearing frocks and tuxedos, and even kilts. Dressed up in dress shoes and a shirt (but no jacket and tie), I felt very under-dressed. Not to mention sweaty from running in a merino jumper. People talked “spatial enablement” and lots of buzzwords. A Minister ministered. Mark Sainsbury officiated. Lights flashed. Entrées were served. Awards were dished out. There was engaging discussion in my immediate neighbourhood, although lots of the surrounding attendees seemed to just be in attendance at a $180 dinner to… do something that I never quite worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently we were highlighting the spatial industry in New Zealand and how cool it is. It felt like a bunch of people patting themselves on the back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s the wine talking, but to be honest, if the “spatial industry” had just spent that money funding PostGIS or GeoServer or Neo4j feature requests… more would have been done for the “spatial industry”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong: the individuals and organisations represented tonight do amazing work. Special congratulations to Interpret Geospatial Solutions for their huge haul of awards, Dr Mairéad de Róiste for her enormously well-deserved award for her hard work establishing the Masters in GIS (of which I am a graduate, and she was my thesis supervisor), Hamish Kingsbury (undergraduate student of the year), and Kim Ollivier (celebrating 30 years of working with spatial information). I’m truly grateful for my award, and the event itself was lovely and well organised. I had a great time talking to interesting and very intelligent people. With delicious food (but not beer and pizza). They even paid for my flights, which had a lot of private benefit as I got to see my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t even think I deserve my award at all after talking to my category competition: superb PhD candidates Judy Rodda from Otago University, and Anton Marais from Waikato University. Judy has been modelling the distribution of the endangered Hector’s dolphins off the south coast of the South Island. Anton made a cellular automaton model of residents’ location and re-location decisions across the Waikato region, extending ten years’ into the future. (It annoys me that I’ve forgotten the name of open source software he used for this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just think the “spatial industry” in NZ is more than a little… self-obsessed. I certainly noticed that tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I wasn’t the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; person who attempted to squeeze in attendance at both the awards and a brilliant session on PostGIS. Without any finger pointing, I think the industry can do better, if indeed there is such a thing as a “spatial industry”. For the record, I don’t even think there is such a thing. We are in a hardware, software and data industry, and that’s just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GeoServer Quickstart with Docker</title>
        <description>&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/docker.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;fullwidth&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/./assets/geoserver.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been exploring &lt;a href=&quot;geoserver.org/&quot;&gt;GeoServer&lt;/a&gt; recently, while also doing the same with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;. I figured I’d share a simple Dockerfile I wrote for getting started with GeoServer (Master) and some extensions, using Docker. I was pleasntly surprised how easy this is to do, after reading a few horrow stories online about getting off the ground with GeoServer. Obviously there’s a lot of additional configuration required before deploying GeoServer, but Docker does at least make it very easy to try something out by ensuring your on the same page as somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot; data-lang=&quot;dockerfile&quot;&gt;# Dockerfile
FROM debian:wheezy

# Update the sources list
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get upgrade -y

# Install basic applications
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential wget unzip

# Get the JRE/JDK installation
RUN apt-get install -y default-jre default-jdk
RUN apt-get install -y openjdk-7-jre openjdk-7-jdk
ENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64

# Get GeoServer
ENV GEOSERVER_HOME=/usr/share/geoserver/
RUN mkdir $GEOSERVER_HOME
RUN wget http://ares.boundlessgeo.com/geoserver/master/geoserver-master-latest-bin.zip
RUN cp geoserver-master-latest-bin.zip $GEOSERVER_HOME
RUN unzip $GEOSERVER_HOME/geoserver-master-latest-bin.zip -d $GEOSERVER_HOME
RUN rm $GEOSERVER_HOME/geoserver-master-latest-bin.zip
ENV GEOSERVER_VER=2.9

# A plugin
ENV A_PLUGIN=geoserver-$GEOSERVER_VER-SNAPSHOT-netcdf-plugin
RUN wget http://ares.boundlessgeo.com/geoserver/master/ext-latest/$A_PLUGIN.zip
RUN cp $A_PLUGIN.zip $GEOSERVER_HOME
RUN ls $GEOSERVER_HOME
RUN ls $GEOSERVER_HOME/geoserver-$GEOSERVER_VER-SNAPSHOT/
RUN unzip $GEOSERVER_HOME/$A_PLUGIN.zip \
-d $GEOSERVER_HOME/geoserver-$GEOSERVER_VER-SNAPSHOT/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/
RUN rm $GEOSERVER_HOME/$A_PLUGIN.zip

ENV GEOSERVER_HOME=$GEOSERVER_HOME/geoserver-$GEOSERVER_VER-SNAPSHOT/
WORKDIR $GEOSERVER_HOME/bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then to build and run the Docker container:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;docker build -t user/geoserver-master:test .
docker run -it --net&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;host&quot;&lt;/span&gt; user/geoserver-master:test
./startup.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have GeoServer running, so head to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost:8080/geoserver&lt;/code&gt;, and login with the default user and password: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;geoserver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to try out GeoServer with data on your machine, you can just mount your data volume to the Docker container and point GeoServer to it in the admin panel. For instance, I mount &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home/data/sampledata&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$GEOSERVER_HOME/data_dir/sampledata&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/compose/&quot;&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There. Now play around with GeoServer. I expect a cheque for 5% of what you would have spent on ArcGIS Server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker hygeine is important, although I’m still figuring it out. I’ve made the image use Debian Wheezy as a lightweight alternative to the Ubuntu 15.04 image I had before. It was also broken because I hadn’t added the command to install &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt;, among a litany of other problems. It usually pays to test things, sorry if you tried it out earlier!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spatial isn&#39;t that special</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This may be a strange thing for me to say, given that my postgraduate qualification, and profession is in geographic information systems. But I don’t think that spatial is particularly special. People pretend it is, and then use that to justify the selling of ridiculous desktop software and “enterprise” solutions to problems that Paul Ramsey here shows can all be solved in a single (PostGIS) SQL query and some wrapper PHP script alongside a slippy map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;65%&quot; height=&quot;500px&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwVRi37qXn8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this headline assertion is not without nuance. While I currently think that 90% of any GIS workflow can and ought to be automated with something like PostGIS-extended PostgreSQL tables, views, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/alpha-beta-soup/6f0fe6a219a014ca9d4d&quot;&gt;upse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/UPSERT&quot;&gt;rts&lt;/a&gt; and trigger functions, that last 10% is actually very, very important. It’s where GIS folk &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; be focusing their attention, given the other problems have been solved by technology. Unfortunately, a lot of people seem to get so caught up inefficiently achieving the fundamental 90% of issues that they don’t actually pay attention to the remaining problems that are actually difficult and/or emerging:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial autocorrelation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metadata&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cartography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;sn-id-cartography&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-id-cartography&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Interactive and otherwise: bad defaults threaten to undo hundreds of years of cartographic experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efficient, client-side implementations of &lt;strong&gt;geometric algorithms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;sn-id-turf&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-id-turf&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;Read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Turfjs/turf&quot;&gt;turf.js&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial accuracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;sn-id-sa&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-id-sa&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;I’ve yet to see a geocoding implementation that even attempts to &lt;strong&gt;record&lt;/strong&gt; accuracy! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modifiable areal unit problem&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ecological fallacy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locational fallacy &lt;label for=&quot;sn-id-lf&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-id-lf&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;e.g. the reduction of an entity to a single point when it is more appropraitly modelled as existing over a mutlidimensional field. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spatial sampling&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stochastic processes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;label for=&quot;sn-id-sp&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle sidenote-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;sn-id-sp&quot; class=&quot;margin-toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sidenote&quot;&gt;My own masters thesis considered this issue for measuring public transport accessibility: bus arrival time is a stochastic process, not a deterministic one. Further, spatial data is too often considered to be a random sample with many observations—I posit instead that it be viewed as a single realisation of a stochastic process. This should hardly be radical, but the gap in the literature for thinking like this is enormous. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the spatial profession (the Twittersphere, where I hear from most of these people), I also don’t feel like enough attention is being paid to emerging and not-so-emerging technologies and how they can revolutionise the way spatial questions are posed and answered, and hopefully assist in shifting some attention to the 10% of real spatial problems, either directly, or by making the 90% more readily accomplishable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/spatial&quot;&gt;Spatially-augmented graph databases&lt;/a&gt; are something that has been piquing my interest recently and I intend to write a blog post about some experiments shortly. Why is no one really talking about them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to hold my breath waiting for the self-delcared GIS commentators on the circle-jerk that is LinkedIn to discuss the relative merits of GeoDjango.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even encounter a NetCDF dataset with an arbitrary number of dimensions, embedded metadata, sigma coordinate systems and irregular grid spacing until I started working around oceanographers and meteorologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is &lt;a href=&quot;http://geogig.org/&quot;&gt;GeoGig&lt;/a&gt; still in beta? Why is no one really using it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turf.js!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are exceptions of course. But if you want to participate in these exceptions, I found some useful advice that builds on the argument that a desktop GIS is increasingly akin to word processing software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So if you’re considering a GIS career, you might want to reframe the question. Instead of learning ArcGIS and getting a GISP certificate, I would recommend that you choose one of 4 paths:
1. geospatial or geostatistical analyst;
2. cartographer or visualization design expert;
3. software developer;
4. Geographic Information Scientist;
Or some combination of the four (and an application area of interest wouldn’t hurt either).  If you only train yourself to be a GIS user you’ll be in the same boat as a professional word processor before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justinholman.com/2012/03/20/spatial-is-indeed-special/&quot;&gt;Justin Holman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Holman notes, the existence of Microsoft Word didn’t make good writers obsolete. In fact probably the opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognise that this post actually comes across as quite condescending. Frankly, I hope it is a little, as that was completely my intention. I mean what I say and a I say what I mean. I know I’m not blameless, and I’m comfortable with that because I recognise it and frequently acquiesce to those who know a lot more than I do about what I make my living in. I know for a fact that a lot of other people aren’t blameless, either. I just worry that many don’t recognise it. As a profession, spatial people should be extolling the merits of the solutions to difficult problems that we have studied. We need less button-clicking, more actual problem solving, because I’m not seeing enough evidence of the latter actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not typists, we’re fucking writers, &lt;em&gt;auteurs&lt;/em&gt;, creators, scientists, and problem solvers. We should be proud of it… and act like it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Parallel geocoding in Python with geopy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Geocoding: the process of taking an address as a piece of semi-structured text, and returning a coordinate somewhere on the surface of the Earth. It’s very unlikely that you’re not going to use an online service to do this. This means a few things. Firstly, that you have to decide on a geocoding provider. Secondly, you’re going to have to sit tight while the geocoding takes place. Python can address both of these issues for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;geopyhttpsgeopyreadthedocsorgen1110&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://geopy.readthedocs.org/en/1.11.0/&quot;&gt;GeoPy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GeoPy is a Python 2/3 module for accessing a whole suite of geocoding web services. As of version 1.10.0, these include: ArcGIS; Baidu; Bing; DataBC; GeocodeFarm; GoecoderDotUS; GeoNames; Google; IGN France; LiveAddress; NaviData; Nominatim (OSM); OpenCage; OpenMapQuest; Yahoo! BOSS Place Finder; What3Words; and Yandex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these, I would recommend Google if you are OK with a reasonably low limit but high tolerance to poorly-formatted addresses, or otherwise Nominatim. Nominatim is free, requires no API token, and only uses OpenStreetMap data. However, OpenMapQuest is even better, as it is also based on OSM, but doesn’t restrict you to geocoding in multiple threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-usage&quot;&gt;Basic usage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using GeoPy is great, because it abstracts away all the details of which provider you’re connecting to. Although I’m yet to try it, it would be trivial to iterate over a set of providers and actually produce multiple geocoded locations per address, perhaps as part of a process to determine error, or to average the returned locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a short sample demonstrating the simplicity of the module:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;geopy.geocoders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Nominatim&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geolocator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Nominatim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;country_bias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;New Zealand&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geocoded&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geolocator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geocode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;Raglan, Waikato&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exactly_one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geocoded&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# success&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geocoded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;latitude&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geocoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;longitude&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Here, perhaps you can run the geocoding function again,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# after cleaning your input a little bit&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Then you have recursion until you get a result!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use OpenMapQuest (for example), you just need to swap it out for Nominatim, and also remove the country bias (which OpenMapQuest doesn’t support).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiprocessing&quot;&gt;Multiprocessing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still a problem, despite all this. Geocoding takes forever. All web services take some time, really. But geocoding is special, given what is actually going on behind the scenes. A list of roughly 500 addresses, most of which needed the recursion I alluded to above, took me about 15 minutes to resolve. Duane Wilkins &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/easy-address-geocoding-duane-wilkins&quot;&gt;posted on LinkedIn recently&lt;/a&gt; that using the Google geocoding service via Google Sheets resulted in about 800 addresses done in about 5 minutes. I suspect that they were clean, but Google is damn fast at geocoding. You’d expect that relative speed difference though: Nominatim is sitting on donated hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However both of these are very slow, in my opinion. Agonisingly so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good Python free lunch to speed this up is to launch mutliple geoprocessing calls asynchronously. In my case, I had a small number of very long and poorly-formatted adddresses that took forever to resolve because the geocoder had to be performed multiple times, most of which resulted in nothing as the string was progressively cleaned, or indeed stripped of information that the geocoder simply could not understand (“5 nm out to sea east of Tauranga” is the best example). What if I could get these slow processes running, and run others alongside, in parallel? This is totally possible! And because Python is batteries-included, it is very, very easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I had a list of objects (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sightings&lt;/code&gt;) which are members of a class that has a method called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;geocode&lt;/code&gt; that essentially launches the geocoding routine I showed you above. (In my case, the function doesn’t return anything, but has the side-effect of setting each Address object’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;latitude&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;longitude&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;addresses&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Gather a list of Address objects with a `geocode`&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;geocode_worker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geocode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Start as many worker processes as you have cores&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;processes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cpu_count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Apply geocode worker to each address, asynchronously&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;addresses&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geocode_worker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;addresses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;__main__&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;A quick gotcha&lt;/span&gt;  is that the worker function has to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled&quot;&gt;able to be pickled&lt;/a&gt;. In simple terms, you have to have the worker function at the top level. The above snippet would not work if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;geocode_worker&lt;/code&gt; were defined within &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;. In that case, you’d see this error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cPickle.PicklingError: Can&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;t pickle &amp;lt;type &#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;&amp;gt;: attribute lookup __builtin__.function failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Don’t use Nominatim for this!&lt;/span&gt;  I made the mistake of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/&quot;&gt;the usage restrictions&lt;/a&gt; of the geocoding service, and forgetting a debug switch, and then launched tens of requests at the same time, repeatedly, hundreds of times, and then had my IP address blocked. Currently I can’t even &lt;em&gt;visit&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/&quot;&gt;http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/&lt;/a&gt;, let alone use the geocoder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restriction is that you must use a single thread. That is, you must not do what I just showed you using Nominatim as your geocoding service, or you will end-up thrashing their limited resources. You also should really cache the results as they come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, OpenMapQuest uses Nominatim but does not have usage restrictions. You can launch some nice parallel processes with this geocoder… just be respectful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I achieved a speed-up of around 20x over the full set. The small number of dirty addresses that earlier caused the geocoder to hang still did so, but real work was going on around them; they were no longer blocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the logs, here’s what the difference in processing looks like for a sample of my addresses. When you see &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/code&gt;, that is when my recursion kicks in that applies an algorithm to clean the address string before trying to geocode again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the difference? In the latter case, there are multiple processes: 8 addresses get geocoded at once. They don’t return in order because they’re all happening at the same time and take different lengths of time to complete depending on their complexity. Failing addresses don’t prevent others from getting underway, and the whole process is so much smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blocking geocoder ran in 16 seconds, while the second took only 4 seconds. Extrapolate that over hundreds of addresses, and before you declare that that is still not worth the effort, look how little code I had to write. It pays off even for very small, one-off jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more that can be done with Python’s builtin multiprocessing, particularly using queues. There are a bunch of third-party modules that also implement the idea. I encourage you to explore, perhaps by looking at tutorials for how to write a daemon, and then make something that polls mutliple related APIs at the same time, populating a common database in near real time.&lt;/p&gt;
