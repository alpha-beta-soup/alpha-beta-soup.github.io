This blog is run by Richard Law, a geographic information systems/science (GIS) developer from Wellington, New Zealand. I am currently based in Raglan, Waikato, where I work for MetOcean Solutions and have been infected with a small weather bug.

I am interested in all things spatial, data, and above all spatial data.  I have a particular enthusiasm for transportation data. Most people probably think I have strong opinions on transportation issues; I wonder how anyone can't. Transportation makes or breaks cities and regions. It affects how we do everything, and whether we do anything.

I like to program. My preferred language is Python, and for woring with spatial data I don't need to go past PostGIS, QGIS, and rasterio. Data visualisation is important and endlessly fascinating.
