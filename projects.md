# [New Zealand Crash Map]({{site.url}}/national-crash-statistics/)

An interactive web map of the New Zealand Transport Agency's (NZTA) Crash Analysis System (CAS) data. The location, causes and circumstances behind each road crash attended by NZ Police can be explored.

This project was [featured](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/data-blog/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503710&objectid=11378832) in the New Zealand Herald on Christmas 2014, becoming the most read article on the website for that day.
