I figured I'd share a simple Dockerfile I wrote for getting started with GeoServer (Master) and some extensions, using Docker. I was pleasntly surprised how easy this is to do, after reading a few horrow stories online about getting off the ground with GeoServer. Obviously there's a lot of additional configuration required before deploying GeoServer, but Docker does at least make it very easy to try something out by ensuring your on the same page as somebody else.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-docker\"># Dockerfile\nFROM debian:wheezy\n\n# Update the sources list\nRUN apt-get update\nRUN apt-get upgrade -y\n\n# Install basic applications\nRUN apt-get install -y build-essential wget unzip\n\n# Get the JRE/JDK installation\nRUN apt-get install -y default-jre default-jdk\nRUN apt-get install -y openjdk-7-jre openjdk-7-jdk\nENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64\n\n# Get GeoServer\nENV GEOSERVER_HOME=/usr/share/geoserver/\nRUN mkdir $GEOSERVER_HOME\nRUN wget http://ares.boundlessgeo.com/geoserver/master/geoserver-master-latest-bin.zip\nRUN cp geoserver-master-latest-bin.zip $GEOSERVER_HOME\nRUN unzip $GEOSERVER_HOME/geoserver-master-latest-bin.zip -d $GEOSERVER_HOME\nRUN rm $GEOSERVER_HOME/geoserver-master-latest-bin.zip\nENV GEOSERVER_VER=2.9\n\n# A plugin\nENV A_PLUGIN=geoserver-$GEOSERVER_VER-SNAPSHOT-netcdf-plugin\nRUN wget http://ares.boundlessgeo.com/geoserver/master/ext-latest/$A_PLUGIN.zip\nRUN cp $A_PLUGIN.zip $GEOSERVER_HOME\nRUN ls $GEOSERVER_HOME\nRUN ls $GEOSERVER_HOME/geoserver-$GEOSERVER_VER-SNAPSHOT/\nRUN unzip $GEOSERVER_HOME/$A_PLUGIN.zip \\\n-d $GEOSERVER_HOME/geoserver-$GEOSERVER_VER-SNAPSHOT/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/\nRUN rm $GEOSERVER_HOME/$A_PLUGIN.zip\n\nENV GEOSERVER_HOME=$GEOSERVER_HOME/geoserver-$GEOSERVER_VER-SNAPSHOT/\nWORKDIR $GEOSERVER_HOME/bin\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then to build and run the Docker container:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">docker build -t user/geoserver-master:test .\ndocker run -it --net=\"host\" user/geoserver-master:test\n./startup.sh\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now you have GeoServer running, so head to <code>localhost:8080/geoserver</code>, and login with the default user and password: <code>admin</code> and <code>geoserver</code>.</p>\n<p>If you want to try out GeoServer with data on your machine, you can just mount your data volume to the Docker container and point GeoServer to it in the admin panel. For instance, I mount <code>/home/data/sampledata</code> to <code>$GEOSERVER_HOME/data_dir/sampledata</code> with <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/\">Docker Compose</a>.</p>\n<p>There. Now play around with GeoServer. I expect a cheque for 5% of what you would have spent on ArcGIS Server.</p>\n<h3>Update</h3>\n<p>Docker hygiene is important, although I'm still figuring it out. I've made the image use Debian Wheezy as a lightweight alternative to the Ubuntu 15.04 image I had before. It was also broken because I hadn't added the command to install <code>wget</code>, among a litany of other problems. It usually pays to test things, sorry if you tried it out earlier!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"GeoServer Quickstart with Docker","date":"09:06 PM, Sunday November 01, 2015","updated":"06:48 PM, Sunday November 08, 2015","path":null},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/geoserver-docker/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/geoserver-docker/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/spatial-is-not-that-special/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spatial isn't that special","updated":null,"date":"2015-11-01T17:00:00.000Z","path":null,"tags":["GIS","opinion"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/nzsea/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Zealand Spatial Excellence Awards","updated":null,"date":"2015-11-19T02:00:00.000Z","path":null,"tags":["GIS","opinion"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
