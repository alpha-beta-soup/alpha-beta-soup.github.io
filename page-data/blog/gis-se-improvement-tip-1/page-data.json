I like GIS.SE, but unless you tweak it, there's a lot of noise and not enough signal. One way to improve that is to add things you're interested in to your <em>Watched Tags</em>, and conversely those things you are disinterested in to your <em>Ignored Tags</em>.</p>\n<p>I personally don't use ArcGIS, or related Esri- or Microsoft-ecosystem tools. So for me, I can't offer any advice on how to do anything with them. Yet there's a lot of people in the spatial community who do use Esri products. I had set up my filters with a very long list of exclusion rules using specific tags, e.g. <code>arcgis-10.4</code>, <code>arcgis-10.5</code>, <code>esri</code>, <code>esri-company</code>, <code>arcgis-online</code>, <code>arcpy</code>, etc. This filtered out a lot of questions I was not interested in reading, however it's very verbose since there are a lot of <code>arc*</code> questions. It is also unwieldy because everytime there's a new ArcGIS major or minor version release, there are a series of new tags created.</p>\n<p>To get around this, you can simply use wildcards in your tags. Now my Ignored Tags are simply <code>.net</code>, <code>arc*</code>, <code>esri*</code>, <code>modelbuilder</code>, <code>oracle</code>, <code>sql-server*</code>. I gave my Watched Tags a similar treatment (e.g. <code>qgis*</code>). Now I have a nice looking set of questions and should not need to revisit my tags as often.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./Screenshot%20from%202018-12-10%2018-14-26.png\" alt=\"Yes, I am intensely interested in people fighting with the antimeridian in spatial software.\" title=\"Yes, I am intensely interested in people fighting with the antimeridian in spatial software.\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"GIS StackExchange Improvement Tip #1","date":"06:04 PM, Monday December 10, 2018","updated":null,"path":null},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/gis-se-improvement-tip-1/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/gis-se-improvement-tip-1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/gatsby-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Gatsby Blog","updated":"2018-12-09T23:43:00.000Z","date":"2018-12-08T21:39:00.000Z","path":null,"tags":["meta"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/recently/2019-07-30/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Recently","updated":"2020-04-29T21:47:00.000Z","date":"2019-07-30T21:30:00.000Z","path":null,"tags":["recently"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
