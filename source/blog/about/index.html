This blog is devoted to showcasing interesting information about public
transportation across New Zealand. This can be in the form of maps and graphs
or any other engaging form of data visualisation. A lot (hopefully) of the content
will be original, but I also intend to include interesting visualisations from
across the Internet.

Posted work is more likely than not to also be presented with comment on the
information, and the visual information design.

Suggestions for neat visualistions are, of course, welcome.

## About the author

Richard Law is currently a Masters thesis student in geographic information
systems (GIS), which is a fancy way of saying he spends all day playing with maps
and modelling geographic processes on computers. His thesis, titled *Waiting and
Weighting: Public Transporation Model Sensitivity to Waiting Time and Schedule
Deviation* is an attempt to better include the unreliability of public transport
(your bus being early or late) in the models that are used to help quanitify and
value infrastructure changes that can make a material difference to how you or
others get around on buses and trains. One day he may blog about it.

If you're tech-inclined, Richard loves Python and SQLite/Spatialite, and plays
with QGIS. CartoDB is a fantastic tool, but primarily because all of my Javascript
is self-taught and thus rather limited. I'm moving towards postgres/PostGIS, but
haven't had significant problems with my current workflow, so the slide is slow.
