  <h2>About this blog</h2>
  <p>
    This blog is devoted to showcasing interesting information about public transportation across New Zealand. This can be in the form of maps and graphs or any other engaging form of data visualisation. A lot (hopefully) of the content will be original, but I also intend to include interesting visualisations from across the Internet.

    Posted work is more likely than not to also be presented with comment on the information, and the visual information design.

    Suggestions for neat visualistions are, of course, welcome.

  <h4>About the author</h4>
  <p>
  I am a Masters thesis student in geographic information systems (GIS), which is a fancy way of saying I spend all day playing with maps and modelling geographic processes on computers. My thesis, titled Waiting and Weighting: Public Transporation Model Sensitivity to Waiting Time and Schedule Deviation is an attempt to better include the unreliability of public transport (your bus being early or late) in the models that are used to help quanitify and value infrastructure changes that can make a material difference to how you or others get around on buses and trains. One day I may blog about it.

  If youâ€™re tech-inclined, I love Python and PostgreSQL/PostGIS.
