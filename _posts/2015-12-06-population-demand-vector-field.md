I just finished reading an interesting paper by Xintao Liu and colleauges entitled *Time-geographic relationships between vector fields of activity patterns and transport systems*, in the Journal of Transport Geography.{% sidenote "sn-id-ref" "Liu, Xintao, Wai Yeung Yan, and Joseph Y.J. Chow. ['Time-geographic relationships between vector fields of activity patterns and transport systems.'](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692314002191) *Journal of Transport Geography* 42 (2015): 22-33." %}

I don't really have much to say about it, but I'll post a link to it anyway so I don't forget about it: I've briefly explored this technique in the past, and hope to revisit it in the future. It's pretty damn hard.

Do you know of any similar examples?
