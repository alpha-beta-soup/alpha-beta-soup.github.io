This blog is run by Richard Law, a geographic information systems/science developer from Wellington, New Zealand.

I am interested in all things spatial data, but I have a particular enthusiasm for transportation. Although I rarely use the label, fundamentally I consider myself somewhat libertarian. This is a position which generally collides with transportation: such a heavily managed space. This just makes for interesting discussions.

Although I think the free market generally leads to efficient transport outcomes, I realise the limitations of a purely libertarian perspective. Without equitable provision for active modes of transport, for example, choosing to walk or cycle would simply not be safe or enjoyable, when the choices that everyone makes ought to be so. At some level, the market falls apart in the provision of transport infrastructure, which only has a limited capacity to be made exclusive, and is subject to astoundingly large positive and negative externalities, particularly in terms of the vibrancy of urban environments.

Beyond essentially political musings on transportation issues, I like to program. My preferred language is Python and you all ought to be using PostGIS. Data visualisation is important and endlessly fascinating. I think having a lifelong enthusiasm for learning is the mark of an interesting person (so I'm also teaching myself the bass guitar and French).

This blog is made with Jekyll, and hosted by Github.
