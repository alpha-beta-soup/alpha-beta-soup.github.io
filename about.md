This blog is run by Richard Law, a geographic information systems/science developer from Wellington, New Zealand. I am currently based in Raglan, Waikato.

I am interested in all things spatial, data, and above all spatial data.  I have a particular enthusiasm for transportation data. Most people probably think I have strong opinions on transportation issues; I wonder how anyone can't. Transportation makes or breaks cities and regions. It affects how we do everything, and whether we do anything.

I like to program. My preferred language is Python and you all ought to be using PostGIS if you're doing GIS heavy-lifting (otherwise QGIS). Data visualisation is important and endlessly fascinating. I think having a lifelong enthusiasm for learning is the mark of an interesting person, so I'm also teaching myself the bass guitar and French, and you'll mostly find me hunched over my desk even though I've finally finished university.

This blog is made with Jekyll, and hosted by Github.
